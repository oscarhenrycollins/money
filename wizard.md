# Money

A simple money app over your bank connection. Review new transactions with one tap, give them a category and a clearer name, add a note, and tick "always use this" to make a rule for next time. See spending by category for any month, and every account's balance.

Add manual accounts for things no bank sees, like a cold-storage Bitcoin wallet (enter the BTC amount; it's valued at the live price). Bring over past history from another money app once, and every row says where it came from.

Money reads from a bank-connection app on your box: SimpleFIN by default, or Monarch or Teller if you have those. It never changes the bank's data. Your reviews, categories, names, notes and rules live in Money's own database, so a fresh sync never overwrites them, and switching connections keeps each connection's edits.
